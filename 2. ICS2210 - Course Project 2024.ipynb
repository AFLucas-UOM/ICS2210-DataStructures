After a brief pause, the terminal is then cleared to proceed to the next phase, in which a randomised array of 1000 integers between 0 and 100000 is generated. This array is used to create another Red-Black Tree labelled `\"Part 2\"`. A `confirmation message` is displayed after both phases of tree construction are completed, indicating that the construction was successful. The constructed trees are then `statistically analysed`, with key metrics such as insertion steps, rotations, tree height, and the number of leaves presented in a structured format to provide insights into their structural properties and performance characteristics."

The skip list's structure is automatically adjusted based on the array size, ensuring optimal performance and balance. Throughout the construction process, a progress bar provides real-time feedback on insertion progress. As each element is added to the skip list, the function systematically tracks and updates the skip list's structure, providing users with an efficient and effective tool for managing and analysing data within skip list structures."

Initially, it shuffles a sorted array with the Knuth shuffle algorithm, creating a skip list labelled `\"Part 1.\"` Then, a random array is generated to create another skip list labelled `\"Part 2.\"` Following completion, both skip lists are `statistically analysed` to present key metrics such as step counts, promotion counts, and the number of levels. This script provides useful insights into skip list behaviour under various input scenarios, allowing us to better understand its efficiency and effectiveness in data organisation and retrieval tasks."

Furthermore, the low average number of rotations (0.466) indicates that AVL Trees `effectively self-balance during insertion operations`, resulting in minimal structural adjustments.
